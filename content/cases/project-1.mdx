# Project 1: Clinic ROAS Optimization

## Challenge

Our client, a medical clinic in Kuala Lumpur, was struggling with low return on ad spend (ROAS) from their digital marketing campaigns. Their existing campaigns were generating leads but at a high cost per acquisition.

## Approach

We implemented a comprehensive digital marketing strategy:

1. **Keyword Research & Optimization**
   - Conducted thorough local SEO research
   - Identified high-intent, low-competition keywords
   - Optimized for location-based searches

2. **Landing Page Optimization**
   - Created dedicated landing pages for each service
   - Implemented A/B testing for conversion optimization
   - Improved page load speed and mobile responsiveness

3. **Campaign Restructuring**
   - Segmented campaigns by service type
   - Implemented negative keyword lists
   - Optimized bidding strategies

## Results

After 3 months of optimization:

- **ROAS increased by 80%**
- Cost per lead reduced by 45%
- Conversion rate improved by 60%
- Monthly revenue increased by 120%
